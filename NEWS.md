# essurvey 1.0.8.9999

# essurvey 1.0.8

- Fixes URL creation big (#53)

# essurvey 1.0.7

- CRAN maintenance release. All vignettes are now precompiled to avoid errors when the ESS website breaks for some reason.
- `ess_email` environmental variable has been renamed to `ESS_EMAIL` to comply with Github Actions standards

# essurvey 1.0.6

- CRAN maintenance release to fix Solaris warnings `Warning in engine$weave(file, quiet = quiet, encoding = enc) : Pandoc (>= 1.12.3) and/or pandoc-citeproc not available. Falling back to R Markdown v1` on CRAN. Tested on Rhub and all passes OK, notifying CRAN.

- Removes automatic citation message when loading package. It's actually annoying.

# essurvey 1.0.5

CRAN maintenance release to add more informative message when the status code of the HTTP request of 'www.europeansocialsurvey.org' is more than 300.

## Minor changes

All tests/examples are now excluded from running on CRAN based on the warning from Brian Ripley:

'Packages which use Internet resources should fail gracefully with an
informative message if the resource is not available (and not give a check
warning nor error).'

They are all forced to run on Travis and Appveyor and this is made clear on the `cran-comments.md`

# essurvey 1.0.4

CRAN maintenance check after release of ESS round 9.

# essurvey 1.0.3

## Breaking changes

* If you don't know which format is available for a round/country, `import_*` and `download_*` functions now accept a NULL argument which runs through `'stata'`, `'spss'` and `'sas'` formats automatically. By default, `import_*` functions have now format set to `NULL` to automatically try the three different formats. This breaks backward dependency but only slightly where it had 'stata' set as default.

## New features

* Users can now download SDDF (weight data) for each country/round combination of files. Functions `show_sddf_cntrounds`, `import_sddf_country` and `download_sddf_country` are now introduced. For technical purposes, `show_sddf_cntrounds` needs for the user to have set their registered ESS email with `set_email`. [#9]

## Minor changes

* Bumps `haven` to minimum package version 2.1.1
* New package website at https://docs.ropensci.org/essurvey

## Internal

* `read_format_data` now tries to read data using `haven` but falls backs to `foreign` in case there's an error. This should only work for SDDF data [#38].
* `read_format_data` and `read_sddf_data` now always return a list. Checking the length of data to return a data frame now happens within each `import_*` function.

## Bug fixes

* Removes an unnecessary if statement in `set_email` that didn't allow to overwrite the email once set.

# essurvey 1.0.2

## Minor changes

* `show_country_rounds` checks if there are missing values and excludes them.

## Breaking changes

`import_all_cntrounds` and `import_country` returned incorrect countries [#31]

# essurvey 1.0.1

## Minor changes

* `ess_email` is now checked that it is not `""` because it wasn't raising an error before.

* Removes the `round` argument from `import_all_cntrounds` because it was a mistake. It already grabs the rounds internally.

# essurvey 1.0.1

Minor release

* Fixes test that checks the number of rounds that each country has. This test was a mistake
because the rounds will change as time passes by and precise country rounds shouldn't be
tested.

# essurvey 1.0.0

The `ess` package has been renamed to `essurvey` for a name conflict with Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS). See R-pkg mailing list, the post related to the release of ess-0-0-1.

## Breaking changes

* `ess_rounds` and `ess_all_rounds` are deprecated and will be removed in the next release. Use `import_rounds` instead [#22]

* `ess_country` and `ess_all_cntrounds` are deprecated and will be removed in the next release. Use `import_countries` instead [#22]

* The `your_email` argument name of `ess_*` functions has be changed to `ess_email` [#23]

## New features

* `import_rounds`, `import_all_rounds` and `download_rounds` have been introduced as
replacements of `ess_rounds` and `ess_all_rounds`. Same changes were repeated for
`ess_country` and `ess_all_cntrounds` [#22]

* `set_email` to set your email as environmental variable rather than write it in each call [#23]

* All requests to the ESS website are now done through HTTPS rather than HTTP [#24]

* Add package level documentation [#20]

## Minor changes

* `ess_email` had no default value but now has `NULL` as default [#23]

* The `format` argument is now checked through `match.arg` rather than manual check [#25]

# ess 0.1.1 (2018-03-05)

## Breaking changes

* Downloading 1 round both for countries or single rounds now returns a data frame rather than a list. If download is more than two rounds it returns a list. [#8]

## New features

* remove_missings() together with remove_numeric_missings() and remove_character_missings() now allow you to recode the typical categories 'Not applicable', 'Don't know', etc.. into NA's. See the vignette example for more details. [#1]

* Can download files in 'stata', 'spss' and 'sas' formats for all functions (both for downloading to user's directory and for reading data). [#11]

* show_themes() and show_theme_rounds() now available to see which themes have been included in which rounds. [#7]

* show_rounds_country() is now available to see which countries participated in which rounds [#14]

## Bug fixes

* The `ouput_dir` argument is now set to `getwd()` rather than `NULL` as default. [#16]

* When parsing country rounds from the ESS table from the website, shaded dots were being interpreted as valid rounds when in fact they're not. show_* funs new exclude shaded dots until they've been added as valid rounds

* If any `ess_*` function can not connect to the ESS website they will return an explicit R error. [#12]

* `ess_all_cntrounds` and `ess_all_rounds` were returning the directory of each of the files. Now they only return the single directory where the files where saved as a message
